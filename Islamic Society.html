    <p class="w3-opacity"><p>Islam does not encourage its followers becoming hermits and living a stoic life. Rather, Islam is a religion of society and encourages the establishment and sustaining of a society in which the members of the society interact and cooperate with each other. Islam wants its followers to live within the society and while staying there, make the existence useful for the members of the society.

      The Islamic society can clearly be distinguished from any other society in the world. It has certain characteristic attributes that differentiate it from the rest of the societies of the world and the identity of a Muslim society is universal and Muslims from different parts of the world can easily form and adjust in an Islamic society, regardless of their cultural differences</p>.</p>

    <h5>To be a successful Muslim husband, be loving, attentive, and respectful of your spouse</h5>
    <div class="container"> <img src="/images/no face.jpg"> </div>
    <p>Quran :<font color="blue">An-Nisa 4:34</font> is the 34th verse in the fourth chapter of the Quran.[1] This verse adjudges the role of a husband as protector and maintainer of his wife and how he should deal with disloyalty on her part.<a href="muslimhasband.html">Agood husband</a> Scholars vastly differ on the implications of this verse, with many Muslim scholars arguing that it serves as a deterrent from anger-based domestic violence.[2][3] The translation of the verse is also subject to debate among Muslim scholars, which can read 'discipline them gently'. Furthermore, as that said in a hadith transmitted by Abu Huraira, slapping someone across their face was forbidden.[4]</p>

        <div class="img-fluid"><img src="/images/rela.jpg" width="50%"></div>
        <p></p>
        <p>Abu Huraira reported that a person came to Allah,'s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and said : Who among the people is most deserving of a fine treatment from my hand ? He said : Your mother. He again said : Then who (is the next one) ? He said: Again it is your mother (who deserves the best treatment from you). He said: Then who (is the next one) ? He (the Holy Prophet) said : Again, it is your mother. He (again) said: Then who? Thereupon he said: Then it is your father. In the hadith transmitted on the authority of Qutalba, there is no mention of the word "the people".</p>
      <p>Abu Huraira reported that a person said: Allah's Messenger, who amongst the people is most deserving of my good treatment? He said: Your mother, again your mother, again your mother,<a href="relative.html">more about relatives</a> then your father, then your nearest relatives according to the order (of nearness).
<br>
<p>Worship God and do not ascribe any partners to Him, and be good to parents, the relatives, the orphans, the needy, the near neighbor and the distant neighbor, the companion at your side, the traveler, and your slaves. Indeed God does not like anyone who is arrogant and braggart. <font color="blue">(Qur’an, 4:36)</font>.</p>
